## Overview
Once a user logs into their account and generates a new playlist, Vibez gathers and stores the playlist's history in a PostgreSQL database along with information for three audio features: music genre, minimum danceability, maximum danceability. Playlists are generated after requesting pertinent info from Spotify's API. Once the backend receives Spotify's JSON, Vibez integrates the JSON into the front end using the Amplitude.js library to showcase its lists of songs and its accompanying shuffle, skip, adjustable volume, scroll, and other convenient functions. In order to display a page of stored playlists, Vibez assimilates interactive, complex visuals rendered by code that is extracted and heavily refactored from the D3.js library. Both Amplitude.js and D3.js require heavy use of jQuery, Javascript, CSS, and HTML. Accessing a stored playlist works similarly as generating a new playlist, except a different Spotify API endpoint is requested.
